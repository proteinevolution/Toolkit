# This file specifies how a particular tool is executed. This is ought to be a very simple
# config language for specifying parameters for tool execution.

# In each block of a particular tool T one has three things that can be done:
# * Access the parameters of the tool with %paramname and attach some logic to it
# * Some functions will be provided that can compute certain values out of parameters
# * The block must return an expression that ultimately describes how the tool is executed
