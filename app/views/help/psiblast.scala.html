                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    The statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences; the default value is 10, meaning that 10 matches are expected to be found merely by chance, according to the stochastic model of Karlin and Altschul (1990). If the statistical significance ascribed to a match is greater than the e-value threshold, the match will not be reported. Lower e-value thresholds are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported. Increasing the threshold shows less stringent matches. Fractional values are acceptable.

                    The statistical significance threshold for including a sequence in the model used by PSI-BLAST to create the PSSM on the next iteration.

                <a class="accordion-title">Filter (low complexity)</a>
                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    Mask off segments of the query sequence that have low compositional complexity, as determined by the SEG program of Wootton & Federhen (Computers and Chemistry, 1993) or, for BLASTN, by the DUST program of Tatusov and Lipman (in preparation). Filtering can eliminate statistically significant but biologically uninteresting reports from the blast output (e.g., hits against common acidic-, basic- or proline-rich regions), leaving the more biologically interesting regions of the query sequence available for specific matching against database sequences. Filtering is only applied to the query sequence (or its translation products), not to database sequences. Default filtering is DUST for BLASTN, SEG for other programs. It is not unusual for nothing at all to be masked by SEG, when applied to sequences in SWISS-PROT, so filtering should not be expected to always yield an effect. Furthermore, in some cases, sequences are masked in their entirety, indicating that the statistical significance of any matches reported against the unfiltered query sequence should be suspect.

                    Restricts the number of short descriptions of matching sequences reported to the number specified; default limit is 100 descriptions. Restricts also database sequences to the number specified for which high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) are reported. If more database sequences than this happen to satisfy the statistical significance threshold for reporting, only the matches ascribed the greatest statistical significance are reported.
