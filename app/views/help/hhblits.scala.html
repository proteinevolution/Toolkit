        <b>Background</b>
        <p>For an accurate sequence-based prediction of protein structure and function, a highly sensitive sequence-search method
            is crucial. Today, profile-profile and HMM-HMM alignment methods are custom when it comes to identification
            and alignment of templates for 3D-homology modeling. As these methods are generally too slow for iteratively
            searching through large databases, we offer HHblits as a 'lightning-fast' HMM-HMM-based iterative sequence
            search tool. The profile-profile alignment prefilter of HHblits reduces the number of full HMM-HMM alignments
            from many millions to a few thousand, making it faster than PSI-BLAST, but still as sensitive as HHsearch.
            Prefiltering is essential for speed and sensitivity. Compared to PSI-BLAST, HHblits is faster, up to twice
            as sensitive and produces more accurate alignments. The HHblits software is part of the open source<br/>
            package <a href = https://github.com/soedinglab/hh-suite target="_blank" rel="noopener">HHsuite</a>.</p><br/>

        <b>Output</b><br/>
        The results of HHblits are organized into five different tabs:<br/><br/>

        The 'Results' tab provides an interactive and detailed summary of the obtained hits. Here, a selection of the
        found hits (either the aligned regions or the full-length sequences) or the query A3M can be forwarded to other
        tools (e.g. HHpred, HHomp). A3Ms for matched templates can be retrieved in the 'Alignments' section by clicking
        on the 'Template alignment' link.<br/><br/>

        The 'Raw Output' tab displays the search results in text format and also offers it for download.<br/><br/>

        The E-value distribution of the obtained hits is presented in the 'E-value Plot' tab.<br/><br/>

        The query-template and query alignments can be visualized, downloaded, and forwarded to other tools in the
        'Query Template MSA' and 'Query Alignment' tabs.<br/>
