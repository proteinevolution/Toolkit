        <p>Modeller is one of the most popular programs for homology modelling. The goal of homology modelling (also called comparative modelling) is to obtain a 3D structure for a protein sequence of interest (the target). One starts from a sequence alignment of the target sequence with one or more template sequences for which the structures are known. Sequences with recognizable sequence similarity (e.g. above 30%) will in general have quite similar 3D structures. Therefore, an alignment with a homologous template of known structure can, in principle, be used to directly predict the main chain coordinates by simply mapping the target sequence into the template main chain structure. Modeller goes a step further in deriving constraints from the multiple alignment of the target with the templates. In addition to a-priori constraints like bond lengths et cetera, these constraints may refer to Calpha-Calpha distances, main-chain dihedral angles, or side-chain dihedral angles. The constraints are formulated probabilistically in terms of probability density functions, that are derived from a statistical analysis of a great number of pairwise structural alignments. Modeller then tries find the parameters (i.e. the model structure) that maximizes the total probability density obtained by combining all constraints. Modeller, as most (if not all) other available programs, has a few important limitations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It cannot correct a wrong or suboptimal target-template alignment. Errors in the alignment will directly translate into errors in the model structures. The alignment errors are the leading source of errors for homology models when the sequence similarity is below ~50%.</li>
            <li>The model is, on average, not more similar to the real target structure than the template used. (This sounds frustrating, but it means that normally, the improvements which the homology modelling software achieves do not fully compensate the alignment errors, on average). For this reason, the other limiting factor in model quality, beside the alignment quality, is the selection of the best template. This is a very difficult task for which a large number of methods and servers have been developed. (See our HHpred server and the links in the section on tertiary structure prediction.)</li>
            <li>Side chain placement gets unreliable below sequence identities of 70%, simply because the position of side chains is conserved less and less below this degree of similarity.</li>
            <li>Loops of more than three or four residues for which no corresponding template atoms are available can not be reliably estimated. They are more or less guessed by the programs. There exist specialized loop modelling methods, but they are very time-consuming and can not be offered over the web. Also, loops of more than 8 to 12 residues can not be modelled reliably.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, homology modelling software can not correct errors in the alignments or templates. What you get out is almost what you put in.</p>
