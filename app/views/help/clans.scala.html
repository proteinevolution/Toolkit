                    The statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences; the default value is 10, meaning that 10 matches are expected to be found merely by chance, according to the stochastic model of Karlin and Altschul (1990). If the statistical significance ascribed to a match is greater than the e-value threshold, the match will not be reported. Lower e-value thresholds are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported. Increasing the threshold shows less stringent matches. Fractional values are acceptable.

                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>Mask off segments of the query sequence that have low compositional complexity, as determined by the SEG program of Wootton & Federhen (Computers and Chemistry, 1993) or, for BLASTN, by the DUST program of Tatusov and Lipman (in preparation). Filtering can eliminate statistically significant but biologically uninteresting reports from the blast output (e.g., hits against common acidic-, basic- or proline-rich regions), leaving the more biologically interesting regions of the query sequence available for specific matching against database sequences.</p>
                    <p>Filtering is only applied to the query sequence (or its translation products), not to database sequences. Default filtering is DUST for BLASTN, SEG for other programs.</p>
                    <p>It is not unusual for nothing at all to be masked by SEG, when applied to sequences in SWISS-PROT, so filtering should not be expected to always yield an effect. Furthermore, in some cases, sequences are masked in their entirety, indicating that the statistical significance of any matches reported against the unfiltered query sequence should be suspect.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Linkage: performs a linkage clustering (you specify the linkage number)</li>
                        <li>Convex: adds sequences to clusters depending on their average "attraction" (proportional to -log P-value). Will fail if a cluster is not "convex", i.e. the majority of sequences do not share an above average pairwise similarity (one parameter "X": the average attraction of a sequence be to a cluster has to be greater than the average global attraction+("X"*STDEV) for it to be added to a cluster).</li>
                        <li>Network: A neural net approach. Each sequence is represented by a neuron and emits a number to all other neurons. The input weights are proportional to -log P-value. In the first round each sequence emits its own sequence numbers. In consecutive rounds, each sequence emits the number which had the largest input weight. This process iterates until no further neurons change their emission number (i.e. the cluster assignment has converged)</li>
