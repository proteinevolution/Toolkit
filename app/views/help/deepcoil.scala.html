        <p>DeepCoil is a method for the accurate prediction of coiled coil domains in protein sequences. A local
        copy and further details on DeepCoil can here obtained here: <a href = https://github.com/labstructbioinf/DeepCoil
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/labstructbioinf/DeepCoil</a>.</p>

        <p>DeepCoil predictions can be made based on a single sequence or based on a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Users
            are provided with the option to enter their own alignment as well as with an option to have the alignment generated
            for their input sequence ('Run_PSI-BLAST' mode). DeepCoil generates a graphical summary of the predictions and
            a text output with probability value for each residue in the sequence to be in a coiled coil domain.</p>
