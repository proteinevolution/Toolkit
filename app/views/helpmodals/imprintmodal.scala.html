        <h6>Legal Structure</h6>
        <p>
            The Max Planck Society is a non-profit research facility which is organized as a registered association.
            All of the institutes and facilities of the Max Planck Society are largely autonomous in terms of organization and research,
            but as a rule have no legal capacity of their own.
        </p>

    <div class="row section">
        <h6>Foreign Language Pages</h6>
        <p>
            To the extent that parts of this Internet site are offered in languages other than German,
            this represents a service exclusively for staff and guests of the Max Planck Society who are not proficient in German.
        </p>

        <h6>Liability for Contents of Online Information</h6>
        <p>
            As the provider of contents in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 of the Tele-Media Law,
            the Max Planck Society shall be responsible for any contents which it makes available for use in accordance with general legal provisions.
            The Max Planck Society makes every effort to provide timely and accurate information on this Web site.
            Nevertheless, errors and inaccuracies cannot be completely ruled out.
            Therefore, the Max Planck Society does not assume any liability for the relevance, accuracy, completeness or quality of the information provided.
            The Max Planck Society shall not be liable for damage of a tangible or intangible nature caused directly or indirectly
            through the use or failure to use the information offered and/or through the use of faulty or incomplete information
            unless it is verifiably culpable of intent or gross negligence. The same shall apply to any downloadable software available free of charge.
            The Max Planck Society reserves the right to modify, supplement, or delete any or all of the information offered on its Internet site,
            or to temporarily or permanently cease publication thereof without prior and separate notification.

        <h6>Links to Internet Sites of Third Parties</h6>
        <p>
            This Internet site includes links to external pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The respective provider shall be responsible for the contents of any linked external pages. In establishing the initial link,
            the Max Planck Society has reviewed the respective external content in order to
            determine whether such link entailed possible civilor criminal responsibility.
            However, a constant review of linked external pages is unreasonable without concrete reason to believe that a violation of the law may be involved.
            If the Max Planck Society determines such or it is pointed out by others that an external offer
            to which it is connected via a link entails civil or criminal responsibility,
            then the Max Planck Society will immediately eliminate any link to this offer. The Max Planck Society expressly dissociates itself from such contents.
