    <h6>Data Collection and Processing</h6>

    <p>We wish to make our websites as appealing and comfortable for you as possible. To this end, analysis of statistical information relating to your utilisation of our websites and the collection of technical details on the web browsers and computers of our online visitors is very helpful for us.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We employ the web analytics tool Piwik for these purposes, which uses cookies and JavaScript to collect information on your computer and automatically forwards it to us (pseudonymised user data). Storing and analysis of data takes place on a central Piwik server, which is operated by the Max Planck Society. Of course, you may object to the collection of data. Objecting is very simple, it only takes one click. Further information on which data is collected and on your options to object is available in our Data Collection Declaration.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    We must advise you, however, that your IP address and perhaps other data related to your person will be transmitted to the service provider concerned and may be stored or analyzed there.

        <br>
        <br>
        1. Activate your browser’s Do-Not-Track setting. As long as this setting is active, our central Piwik server will not store any data about you. Note: As a rule, the Do-Not-Track setting is only valid for the specific computer and the specific browser in which you activate this setting. Should you use more than one computer or browser, please make sure to activate the Do-Not-Track setting on all of them separately.
        <br>
        <br>
        2. You can also use our Opt-out function. To do so, please tick the box below, to stop the
        collection of data or to activate it again. As long as the box is deactivated, our central Piwik server will not store any data about you. Note: For the Opt-out function, we need to save a special recognition cookie to your browser. If you delete this cookie or use another computer/browser, please make sure to object to the collection of data again on this website.
