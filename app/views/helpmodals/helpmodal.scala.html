    <h5>Welcome to the MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit</h5>
    <hr><br>

    <div class="row section">
        <p>The MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit is a platform that integrates a great variety of
            tools for protein sequence analysis. Many tools are developed in-house, and several
            public tools are offered with extended functionality.
        </p>
        <p>The toolkit includes, among others: PSI-BLAST+, HHblits, HMMER;
            MUSCLE, MAFFT, ProbCons; HHrepID, PCOILS;HHpred, Modeller;
            CLANS, ANCESCON, PhyML; RetrieveSeq, HHfilter.
        </p>

    <div class="row section">
        <h6>Job submission</h6>
        <p>
            Each tool has a separate input page with a web form in which the user can input sequence data,
            upload sequence files, and specify options. All tools that take alignments
            as input accept FASTA and CLUSTAL formats. Upon submission, each job is assigned an unique
            identifier; You may also choose your own job-names to organize your work.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="row section">
        <h6>Job management</h6>
        <p>
            Located on the left of the screen is a sidebar pane that holds a status
            list of all recent jobs in the current session. You can click
            on previously submitted jobs to check their status and view their results. An icon above the list
            provides access to the job manager, which allows easy searching and ordering of jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general a session will last until the web browser is closed. However,
            because of different session implementations by the various browser types, jobs
            may occasionally disappear from the joblist. Therefore, noting down the job ids is
            recommended. Anonymous job results are stored for <strong>three
            weeks</strong>, whereas jobs of logged-in users are stored for <strong>three months</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please keep in mind, that the toolkit is focused on providing tools,
            not on storing results or other data: We don't make backups of your
            results. If the storage medium crashes or your job is deleted, we
            cannot restore it! After removal or updates of databases or tools, you
            probably will not be able to get the same results any more, even if
            you still know your input parameters. It's your task to save your
            results and databases.
        </p>

        <h6>Inter-connectivity</h6>
        <p>
            Most of the tools in the Toolkit are
            interconnected, allowing job results of one tool to be forwarded as input to
            others. For example, you could run PSI-BLAST+, parse out a multiple alignment of selected
            hits and send the results to the cluster analysis tool CLANS.
