/**
  * This class takes care of the job deletion routine.
  * An asynchronous task is executed on the Toolkit startup

  * A list of all jobs that were delete is written to a file
  * and to the deletedCollection in mongoDB
  *
  * This routine includes:
  *
  * 1.  finding jobs of non registered users
  *     which are older than deletionThreshold and
  *     jobs of registered users which are older than
  *     userThresholdRegistered
  * 2.  finding the corresponding user to the job
  * 3.  pull job from watchlist, delete from ElasticSearch
  * 4.  if jobs has no ownerID or user is not found:
  *     delete job from ElasticSearch
  * 5.  delete job folder, resultCollection,
  *     jobAnnotationCollection and jobCollection in mongoDB
