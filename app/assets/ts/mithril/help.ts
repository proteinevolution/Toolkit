    "pcoils": ["<h3>Recommendations</h3>COILS with the MTIDK matrix is specific for solvent-exposed, left-handed coiled coils. Other types of coiled-coil structure, such as buried coiled coils (e.g the central coiled coil in catabolite repressor protein, or some transmembrane domains) and right-handed coiled coils, are not detected. COILS does not reach yes-or-no decisions based on a threshold value. Rather, it yields a set of probabilities that presumably reflect the coiled-coil forming potential of a sequence. This means that even at high probabilities (e.g. >90%), there will be (and should be) sequences that in fact do not form a coiled coil, though they may have the potential to do so in a different context. COILS is biased towards hydrophilic, highly charged sequences. For this reason, all scans should be performed with a weighted and an unweighted matrix, and the results compared. Differences of more than 20-30 percentage points in the probabilities should be taken to indicate that a coiled-coil structure is unlikely, the elevated scores being mainly due to the high incidence of charged residues (note, though, that this would have marked human mannose-binding protein as a false positive). The MTIDK matrix assigns high probabilities to known coiled coils segments, but identifies different helices at high probability in a database of globular proteins. This is a surprising feature whose reason is as yet unclear, but which can be exploited for predictive purposes. It is therefore useful to compare the results of scans made with the two matrices. Again, differences of more than 20-30 percentage points in the probabilities should be taken to indicate that a coiled-coil structure is unlikely (note, though, that this threshold would make the replication terminator protein a border-line case). The resolution between globular and coiled-coil score distributions decreases strongly with a decreasing size of the scanning window. The prediction of new coiled-coil segments should therefore be made using a 28 residue window, or in special cases a 21 residue window. 14 residue windows should normally be reserved for the analysis of local parameters (such as the frame) in known or predicted coiled coils. The ends of coiled-coil segments appear to be most accurately identified in a 21 residue window. In general, it is assumed that residues with probabilities >50% are part of a coiled-coil segment. Sequences with high coiled-coil probabilitiy from globular proteins rarely exceed a length of 30 residues. None is longer than 35 residues. Sequences with probabilities >80-90% that extend for more than 35 residues are therefore more likely to assume a coiled-coil structure than is indicated by the obtained probabilities. Where possible, sequences related to the protein of interest should also be analyzed for predicted coiled-coil segments (e.g. by using a sequence alignment instead of a single sequence as input). It should be kept in mind, though, that the sequences must be related in the region of high scores in order for the comparison to be significant.<br/><h3>PSIPRED</h3>Comparison of the coiled-coil prediction with predictions of the secondary structure are generally useful, particularly if multiple related sequences are available.

By comparing this score to the distribution of scores in globular and coiled-coil proteins, the program then calculates the probability that the sequence will adopt a coiled-coil conformation.

    "modeller": ["Modeller is one of the most popular programs for homology modelling. The goal of homology modelling (also called comparative modelling) is to obtain a 3D structure for a protein sequence of interest (the target). One starts from a sequence alignment of the target sequence with one or more template sequences for which the structures are known. Sequences with recognizable sequence similarity (e.g. above 30%) will in general have quite similar 3D structures. Therefore, an alignment with a homologous template of known structure can, in principle, be used to directly predict the main chain coordinates by simply mapping the target sequence into the template main chain structure. Modeller goes a step further in deriving constraints from the multiple alignment of the target with the templates. In addition to a-priori constraints like bond lengths et cetera, these constraints may refer to Calpha-Calpha distances, main-chain dihedral angles, or side-chain dihedral angles. The constraints are formulated probabilistically in terms of probability densitiy functions, that are derived from a statistical analysis of a great number of pairwise structural alignments. Modeller then tries find the parameters (i.e. the model structure) that maximizes the total probability density obtained by combining all constraints. Modeller, as most (if not all) other available programs, has a few important limitations:<br/><br/><ul><li>It can not correct a wrong or suboptimal target-template alignment. Errors in the alignment will directly translate into errors in the model structures. The alignment errors are the leading source of errors for homology models when the sequence similarity is below ~50%.</li><li>The model is, on average, not more similar to the real target structure than the template used. (This sounds frustrating, but it means that normally, the improvements which the homology modelling software achieves do not fully compensate the alignment errors, on average). For this reason, the other limiting factor in model quality, beside the alignment quality, is the selection of the best template. This is a very difficult task for which a large number of methods and servers have been developed. (See our HHpred server and the links in the section on tertiary structure prediction.)</li><li>Side chain placement gets unreliable below sequence identities of 70%, simply because the position of side chains is conserved less and less below this degree of similarity.</li><li>Loops of more than three or four residues for which no corresponding template atoms are available can not be reliably estimated. They are more or less guessed by the programs. There exist specialized loop modelling methods, but they are very time-consuming and can not be offered over the web. Also, loops of more than 8 to 12 residues can not be modelled reliably.</li></ul><br/>In summary, homology modelling software can not correct errors in the alignments or templates.
