    "Database": "The selected databases are used by BLAST to perform the search. <br /> - <b>nr:</b> the non-redundant sequence database at the NCBI, updated weekly. (See NCBI's BLAST tutorial). <br /> - <b>env:</b> NCBI's env database with environnmental sequences, usually from unknown organisms. <br /> - <b>nre:</b> nr+env database. Updated weekly. <br /> - <b>nr90, nr70, env90 etc.:</b> representative sequences, filtered for a maximum pairwise sequence identity of ~90% or 70% with kClust. Updated bimonthly. <br /> - <b>nr_euk, nr_bac, nr_arc, nr_pro, nr_vir:</b> eukaryotic, bacterial, archaeal, prokaryotic, and viral sequences from the non-redundant database nr. Updated weekly. <br /> - <b>uniprot_sprot:</b> http://www.expasy.org/sprot/ Updated weekly. <br /> - <b>uniprot_trembl:</b> http://www.ebi.ac.uk/swissprot/ Updated weekly. <br /> - <b>pdb_nr: Sequences</b> from proteins whose structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank PDB.

    "Matrix": "Specify an alternate scoring matrix for PSIBLAST.",
    "Number of Iterations": "Specify the maximum number of rounds of search. After each successive round the search alignment is updated. ",
    "E-Value": "The statistical significance threshold for reporting matches against database sequences; the default value is 10, meaning that 10 matches are expected to be found merely by chance, according to the stochastic model of Karlin and Altschul (1990). If the statistical significance ascribed to a match is greater than the e-value threshold, the match will not be reported. Lower e-value thresholds are more stringent, leading to fewer chance matches being reported. Increasing the threshold shows less stringent matches. Fractional values are acceptable.",
    "E-value inclusion threshold": "The statistical significance threshold for including a sequence in the model used by PSI-BLAST to create the PSSM on the next iteration.",
    "Filter (low complexity)": "Mask off segments of the query sequence that have low compositional complexity, as determined by the SEG program of Wootton & Federhen (Computers and Chemistry, 1993) or, for BLASTN, by the DUST program of Tatusov and Lipman (in preparation). Filtering can eliminate statistically significant but biologically uninteresting reports from the blast output (e.g., hits against common acidic-, basic- or proline-rich regions), leaving the more biologically interesting regions of the query sequence available for specific matching against database sequences. Filtering is only applied to the query sequence (or its translation products), not to database sequences. Default filtering is DUST for BLASTN, SEG for other programs. It is not unusual for nothing at all to be masked by SEG, when applied to sequences in SWISS-PROT, so filtering should not be expected to always yield an effect. Furthermore, in some cases, sequences are masked in their entirety, indicating that the statistical significance of any matches reported against the unfiltered query sequence should be suspect.",
    "Compute Smith-Waterman alignment": "Compute locally optimal Smith-Waterman alignments.",
    "Use nr70 for all but last iteration": " If this option is selected the programm will use the nr70-database for all but last round. In the last round, the database you selected in the database section will be used.",
    "Alignments and descriptions": "Restricts the number of short descriptions of matching sequences reported to the number specified; default limit is 100 descriptions. Restricts also database sequences to the number specified for which high-scoring segment pairs (HSPs) are reported. If more database sequences than this happen to satisfy the statistical significance threshold for reporting, only the matches ascribed the greatest statistical significance are reported."
