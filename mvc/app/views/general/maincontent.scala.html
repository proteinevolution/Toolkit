  The Bioinformatics Toolkit is a platform that integrates a great variety of
        tools for protein sequence analysis. Many tools are developed in-house, and several
        public tools are offered with extended functionality.

<h2>Most frequently used tools</h2>
    </p>
    <p class="message" align="justify">
        <b><a href=hhpred>HHpred</a></b> Sensitive protein homology detection and structure prediction by HMM-HMM-comparison. Starting from a query sequence, HHpred builds a multiple sequence alignment
        using HHblits and turns it into a profile HMM. This is then compared it with a database of HMMs representing proteins with known structure (e.g. PDB, SCOP) or annotated protein
        families (e.g. PFAM, SMART, CDD, COGs, KOGs). The output is a list of closest homologs with alignments.
        HHpred can also build 3d homology models using the identified templates in the PDB database. It can optimize template picking and query-template alignments for
        homology modeling.
        <br>The HHblits software is part of the open source package <a href="ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/pub/HH-suite/" target="_self">HHsuite</a>.<br>
        <br>
        <b><a href=hhblits>HHblits</a></b> Remote homology detection method based on iterative HMM-HMM comparison. HHblits can build high-quality MSAs starting from single sequences or from MSAs.
        It transforms these into a query HMM and iteratively searches through uniprot20 or nr20 databases by adding significantly similar sequences from the previous
        search to the updated query HMM for the next search iteration. Compared to PSI-BLAST, HHblits is faster, up to twice as sensitive and produces more accurate alignments.
        <br>
        The HHblits software is part of the open source package <a href="ftp://toolkit.genzentrum.lmu.de/pub/HH-suite/" target="_self">HHsuite</a>.

        <br>
        <b><a href=quick2_d>Quick2d</a></b> Quick2D gives you an overview of secondary structure features like alpha-helices, extended beta-sheets,
        coiled coils, transmembrane helices and disorder regions.
        Predictions by PSIPRED, JNET, Prof(Rost), Prof(Ouali), Coils, MEMSAT2, HMMTOP, DISOPRED2 and VSL2.<br>
        <br>

        <b><a href=modeller>Modeller</a></b> A Program for Comparative Protein Structure Modelling by Satisfaction of Spatial Restraints.<br>
        <br>

        <b><a href=pcoils>Coils/PCoils</a></b> This server compares a single sequence (COILS) or a sequence alignment (PCOILS) to a database of known coiled-coils
        and derives a similarity score. The program then calculates the probability that the sequence will adopt a coiled-coil conformation.<br>
        <br>
        <b><a href=psi_blast>PSI-Blast</a></b> Search with an amino acid sequence against protein databases for locally similar sequences. Similar to ProteinBLAST but more sensitive.
        PSI-BLAST first performs a BLAST search and builds an alignment from the best local hits. This alignment is then used as a query for the next round of search.
        After each successive round the search alignment is updated.<br>

<h2>Alternative Toolkit Location</h2>
    </p>
    <p class="message" align="justify">

  You also can use our partner Bioinformatics Toolkit at the <a href="http://toolkit.lmb.uni-muenchen.de/">Gene Center</a> of the Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich

<h2>Job submission</h2>
    </p>
    <p class="message" align="justify">
    Each tool has a
        separate input page with a web form in which the user can input sequence data,
        upload sequence files, and specify options. All tools that take alignments
        as input accept the most widely used formats (FASTA, CLUSTAL, Stockholm and
        A3M). You may also choose your own job-names to organize your work.
        Snail symbols inside the submit buttons inform you about tools that
        typically run for more than 10 minutes.

    <p class="message" align="justify">
<h2>Job management</h2>
    </p>
    <p class="message" align="justify">
    Located on the left of the screen is a sidebar pane that holds a status
        and section-coded list of all recent jobs in the current session. You can click
        on previously submitted jobs to check their status and view their results.<br>
        In general a session will last until the web browser is closed. However,
        because of different session implementations by the various browser types, jobs
        may occasionally disappear from the joblist. Therefore, noting down the job ids is
        recommended. Anonymous job results are stored <strong>two
        weeks</strong>, whereas jobs of logged-in users are stored at least <strong>two months</strong>.
  </p>
    <p class="message" align="justify">
Please keep in mind, that the toolkit is focussed on providing tools,
        not on storing results or other data: We don't backup of your
        results. If the storage medium crashes or your job is deleted, we
        cannot restore it! After removal or updates of databases or tools, you
        probably will not be able to get the same results any more, even if
        you still know your input parameters. It's your task to save your
        results and databases.

<h2>Interconnectivity</h2>
    </p>
    <p class="message" align="justify">
    Most of the tools in the Toolkit are
        interconnected, allowing job results of one tool to be forwarded as input to
        others. For example, you could run PSI-BLAST, parse out a multiple alignment of selected
        hits and send the results to a cluster analysis tool.
    </p>

    <p class="message" align="justify">
<h2>User databases</h2>
    </p>
    <p class="message" align="justify">
    You may upload customized databases which are then accessible throughout the whole toolkit (upload once, use many times).
