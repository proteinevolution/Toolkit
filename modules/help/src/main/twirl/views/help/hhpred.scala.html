        <h5><b>HHpred server for protein remote homology detection and 3D structure prediction</b></h5>
        <p>HHpred is a method for sequence database searching and structure prediction that is as easy to use as BLAST
            or PSI-BLAST and that is at the same time much more sensitive in finding remote homologs.
            In fact, HHpred's sensitivity is competitive with the most powerful servers for structure prediction currently
            available.</p>
        <p>HHpred is based on the pairwise comparison of profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). Whereas most conventional
            sequence search methods search sequence databases such as UniProt or the NR, HHpred searches alignment
            databases, like Pfam or SMART. This greatly simplifies the list of hits to a number of sequence families
            instead of a clutter of single sequences. All major publicly available profile and alignment databases
            are available through HHpred.</p>
        <p>HHpred accepts a single query sequence or a multiple alignment as input. Within only a few minutes it returns
            the search results in an easy-to-read format similar to that of PSI-BLAST. Search options include local or
            global alignment and scoring secondary structure similarity. HHpred can produce pairwise query-template
            sequence alignments, merged query-template multiple alignments, as well as 3D structural models calculated
            by the MODELLER software from HHpred alignments.</p>
        <h5><b>When can HHpred be useful for you?</b></h5>
        <p>It is well known that sequence search methods such as BLAST, PSI-BLAST, and/or HMMER are of prime importance
            for biological research because functional information of a protein or gene can be inferred from
            homologous proteins or genes identified in a sequence search. But quite often no significant relationship
            to a protein of known function can be established. This is certainly the case for the most interesting
            groups of proteins, for which no ortholog has yet been studied.</p>
        <p>When conventional sequence search methods fail, HHpred often allows the detection of remote relationships,
            enabling derivation of hypotheses about possible mechanisms, active site positions and residues, or the class
            of substrate bound. When a homologous protein with known structure can be identified, its structure can be
            used as a template to model the 3D structure for the protein of interest. The 3D model may then help to
            generate hypotheses to guide experiments.</p>
        <h5><b>What is HMM-HMM comparison and why is it so powerful?</b></h5>
        <p>When searching for remote homologs, it is wise to make use of as much information about the query and
            database proteins as possible in order to better distinguish true from false positives and to produce
            optimal alignments. This is the reason why sequence-sequence comparison is inferior to profile-sequence
            comparison. Sequence profiles contain for each column of a multiple alignment the frequencies of the 20
            amino acids. They therefore contain detailed information about the conservation of each residue position,
            i.e. how important each position is for defining other members of the protein family, and about the preferred
            amino acids. Profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are similar to simple sequence profiles,
            but in addition to the amino acid frequencies in the columns of a multiple sequence alignment
            they contain information about the frequency of inserts and deletions at each column.
            Using profile HMMs in place of simple sequence profiles should therefore further improve sensitivity. Using
            HMMs both on the query and the database side greatly enhances the sensitivity and selectivity over
            sequence-profile based methods such as PSI-BLAST.</p>
        <h5><b>Structure prediction with HHpred</b></h5>
        <p>The most successful techniques for protein structure prediction rely on identifying homologous sequences
            with known structure to be used as template. This works so well because structures diverge much more slowly
            than sequences and homologous proteins may have very similar structures even when their sequences have
            diverged beyond recognition. But sensitivity in homology detection is crucial for success since many
            proteins have only remote relatives in the structure database.</p>
            <p>To generates a homology model, please chose PDB_mmCIF70 as the target database. Once the search has run
            through, analyse the obtained hits and select the best hits as templates for modelling. Next, click on the
            'Model using selection' option located at the top of the Results page.</p>

        <h5><b>How can I verify if a database match is homologous?</b></h5>
        <p>Here is a list of things to check if a database match really is at least locally homologous.</p>
        <p><b>Check probability and E-value:</b> HHsearch can detect homologous relationships far
            beyond the twilight zone, i.e., below 20% sequence identity. Sequence identity is therefore not an
            appropriate measure of relatedness anymore. The estimated probability of the template to be (at least partly)
            homologous to your query sequence is the most important criterion to decide whether a template HMM is actually
            homologous or just a high-scoring chance hit. When it is larger than 95%, say, the homology is nearly certain.
            Roughly speaking, one should give a hit serious consideration (i.e., check the other points in this list)
            whenever (1) the hit has > 50% probability, or (2) it has > 30% probability and is among the top three hits.
            The E-value is an alternative measure of statistical significance. It tells you how many chance hits with a
            score better than this would be expected if the database contained only hits unrelated to the query. At
            E-values below one, matches start to get marginally significant. Contrary to the probability, when
            calculating the E-value HHsearch and HHblits do not take into account the secondary structure similarity.
            Therefore, the probability is a more sensitive measure than the E-value.</p>

        <p><b>Check if homology is biologically suggestive or at least reasonable:</b> Does the database hit have a
            function you would expect also for your query? Does it come from an organism that is likely to contain a
            homolog of your query protein?</p>

        <p><b>Check secondary structure similarity:</b> If the secondary structure of query
            and template is very different or you can’t see how they could fit together in 3D, then this is a reason
            to distrust the hit. Note however that if the query alignment contains only a single sequence, the secondary
            structure prediction is quite unreliable and confidence values are overestimated.</p>

        <p><b>Check relationship among top hits:</b> If several of the top hits are homologous to each other,
            (e.g. when they are members of the same SCOPe superfamily), then this will considerably reduce the
            chances of all of them being chance hits, especially if these related hits are themselves not very
            similar to each other. Searching the SCOP database is very useful precisely for this reason, since
            the SCOPe family identifier (e.g. a.118.8.2) allows to tell immediately if two templates are likely
            homologs.</p>

        <p><b>Check for possible conserved motifs:</b> Most homologous pairs of alignments will have at least
            one (semi-)conserved motif in common. You can identify such putative (semi-)conserved motifs by
            the agglomeration of three or more well-matching columns (marked with a ’|’ sign between the
            aligned HMMs) occurring within a few residues, as well as by matching consensus sequences. Some
            false positive hits have decent scores due to a similar amino acid composition of the template. In
            these cases, the alignments tend to be long and to lack conserved motifs.</p>

        <p><b>Check residues and role of conserved motifs:</b> If you can identify possible conserved motifs,
            are the corresponding conserved template residues involved in binding or enzymatic function?</p>

        <p><b>Check query and template alignments:</b> A corrupted query or template alignment is the
            main source of high-scoring false positives. The two most common sources of corruption in an
            alignment are (1) non-homologous sequences, especially repetitive or low-complexity sequences in
            the alignment, and (2) non-homologous fragments at the ends of the aligned database sequences.
            Check the query and template MSAs in an alignment viewer.</p>

        <p><b>Realign with other parameters:</b> change the alignment parameters. Choose global instead
            of local mode, for instance, if you expect your query to be globally homologous to the putative
            homolog. Try to improve the probability by changing the values for minimum coverage or minimum
            sequence identity. You can also run the query HMM against other databases.</p>

        <p><b>Build the query and/or database MSAs more aggressively:</b> If your query (or template)
            MSA is not diverse enough, you could increase sensitivity substantially by trying to include more
            remotely homologous sequences into the MSA. You can, for instance, make the MSA building criteria less
            stringent, or search with PSI-BLAST over nre70.</p>

        <p><b>Verify predictions experimentally:</b> The ultimate confirmation of a homologous relationship
            or structural model is, of course, the experimental verification of some of its key predictions, such
            as validating the binding to certain ligands by binding assays, measuring biochemical activity, or
            comparing the knock-out phenotype with the one obtained when the putative functional residues
            are mutated.</p>

                    unknown, the PSIPRED-predicted secondary structure will be used. To force HHpred to use predicted
                    instead of actual secondary structure, choose "predicted vs predicted only". Scoring the secondary
                    structure similarity improves sensitivity and also alignment quality significantly. Since the weight
                    of the secondary structure score is small (15% of the amino acid similarity score), the risk
                    for high-scoring non-homologous matches is still small.

                        database sequences. In global mode, it uses global alignments with no end gap penalties
                        (sometimes called 'global-local' alignments), i.e. the query-template alignments extend up to
                        the beginning and end of the query or template sequence. The use of local mode is strongly
                        recommended if you want to know which are your most likely remote homologs. If you have already
                        identified your template with a previous run in local mode, you can use the global mode to get
                        global alignments with an already identified template. HHpred was shown to be significantly more
                        sensitive to detect remote homologs in local than in global mode. The reason is that most remote
                        homologs are really only homologous in a common core that define their superfamily. This core has
                        been adorned by other secondary structure elements in different ways in different families.
                        Also, the statistical evaluation is more error-prone for the global alignment mode, since the
                        negatives score distribution for global alignments does not follow an extreme-value distribution.
                        You may generate global alignments and at the same time score alignments with the more sensitive
                        local Viterbi alignment by selecting the 'local' option in combination with the option
                        'Realign with MAC' and setting the 'MAC realignment threshold' to 0.0.</p>

                    <p>After the search with the standard Viterbi algorithm, this option will cause HHpred to realign all
                        query-template alignments with the more accurate Maximum ACcuracy alignment algorithm. Since for
                        technical reasons the scores, E-values, and probabilities from the Viterbi alignment and NOT the
                        MAC alignment are displayed and used for ranking, the MAC realignment option may lead to high-scoring
                        alignments of length 1. This happens when the MAC algorithm cannot find any acceptable alignment
                        path, which is an indication for a non-homologous relationship. When the MAC realignment option
                        is activated, the 'global' and 'local' options now refer to both the Viterbi search stage as well
                        as the MAC realignment stage.</p>

                    Only active when the 'Realign with MAC algorithm' and the 'local' option is active. This parameter
                    controls the MAC alignment algorithm's greediness. More precisely, the MAC algorithm finds the
                    alignment that maximizes the sum of posterior probabilities minus this threshold for each aligned
                    pair. Global alignments are generated with 0, whereas 0.5 will produce quite conservative local
                    alignments with average probabilities for each aligned pair of residues above 50%. Default value is
                    0.3, which produces alignments of roughly the same length as the Viterbi algorithm.
