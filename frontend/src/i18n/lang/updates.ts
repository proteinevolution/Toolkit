            <b>Release Notes</b>: Welcome to the new version of the
            MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear Toolkit Users,<br>
            <br>
            welcome to the new version of the MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit hosted at the Department of Protein Evolution,
            Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Germany.
            The first version of the Toolkit was released in 2005
            and has serviced over 2.5 million external queries to date.
            We had to rework the Toolkit entirely because of mounting software incompatibility with our
            computing infrastructure and also took this opportunity to improve some features
            and prune a few of the outdated and less-widely used tools.
            To allow an easy transition to the new Toolkit, we have retained the basic structure and
            UI features of the earlier version, and have added additional features, some of
            which are listed below, to enhance user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>New tools</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>PhyML is offered instead of PHYLIP-NEIGHBOR for phylogenetic inference.</li>
            <li>MMseq2s is offered instead of BLASTClust for clustering of up to 20,000 sequences.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>New features/changes</em>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HHpred allows comparison of two sequences or MSAs, replacing HHalign.</li>
            <li>CLANS allows clustering of up to 10,000 sequences.</li>
            <li>BLAST+ and PSI-BLAST+ are offered as a single tool.</li>
            <li>Caching of results for quick retrieval of pre-computed jobs.</li>
            <li>Search box on the index page for quick access to tools and jobs.</li>
            <li>Job manager in addition to joblist for easy management of jobs.</li>
            <li>E-mail notifications are only available to logged-in users.</li>
            <li>Comprehensive client-side input validation.</li>
            <li>Significantly enhanced performance, owing to upgraded computational infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Coming soon</em>
            <br>
            We are going to bring back FRpred, HHomp, Quick2D, daTAA, and REPPER within the next few weeks.
            Additionally, we are going to offer many more proteome databases for
            HHpred over the next months and are also working on making the
            help pages more comprehensive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new Toolkit is still under active development and
            we invite you to send us your feature requests and bug reports
            (<a href="mailto:mpi-toolkit&commat;tuebingen.mpg.de">mpi-toolkit&commat;tuebingen.mpg.de</a>).
